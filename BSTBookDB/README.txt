NOTE : 
Everything works very well except from

Option 4 isn't fully functional about 90% correct, the array have all the books from the tree

Option 6 - Honestly, we tried but this method is purely based on trial by error
It was harder than we expected :(((( The graph looks correct though, with the books that we actually got into the isbn array.
