# PLAGIARISM CHECKER written for a TripAdvisor Interview

Assumptions made:
   * case sensitivity doesn't matter
   * non letters are not considered, so punctuations and all others are removed from text
   * plurals are seen as completely different words (i.e. cup and cups are two different words)

./src contains the main class (PlagiarismDetector), and the NTupleComparator class contains most the functionality
./test contains NTupleComparator class to make sure code work as expected

file1, file2, testfile2 and syns the contain texts for the sample cases given in the e-mail description

mysamplefile1, mysamplefile2, and mysynonyms are the custom text files I made
